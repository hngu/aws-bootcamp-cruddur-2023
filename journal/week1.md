# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

# My Notes
- Containerize your app whenever possible unless you are prototyping
- DockerHub/ECR like a github to store your docker images
- Jfrog - for storing artifacts or binaries like jars or libraries
- Docker VSCode extension recommended
- Each command in Dockerfile creates a layer that gets unified
